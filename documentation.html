		<H2> Project Documentation </H2>
		<H3> Design Process </H3>
			<p> As an avid reader and self proclaimed book enthusiast, I wanted to 
				do the final project with a data set relating to books in some way. <br/>
				After a few searches I found the Goodreads-books data set on Kaggle. This
				data set is a comprehensive list of all the books on the <br/> Goodreads app, 
				along with the books' respective author(s), average rating, isbn, number of 
				pages, number of ratings, and number of <br> text ratings. After viewing the
				data set the question I decided to pose as my research question is: What 
				books have the most ratings <br/> and how do the average ratings compare 
				between the books with the most ratings? 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				My first design to answer this question was a bar plot with the title 
				of the book on the x-axis and the average rating on the y-axis. <br/> Then, 
				when you hover over the individual bars a tooltip will display the 
				exact average rating for that specific book. The overall <br/> design stayed
				the same throughout the process of creating the visualization. However, 
				I learned that I needed to be much more <br/> specific in my design. On my 
				first attempt, I filtered the data by books who have greater than 100,000
				reviews. This lead to a very <br/> messy graph with way too many bars for
				it to be easily understandable. 
				</br/>

				 <figcaption> Fig 1: Books with more than 100,000 ratings </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				After texting out a few different values for the minimum number of ratings
				I decided on 1,500,000 as this resulted in 18 books/bars <br/> to be displayed.
				Now that the graph is legible, I realized that it would be nice if the 
				number of ratings was also displayed in the tool <br/> tip to provide more
				information to the viewer.

			</figure>
			<p>
				At this point the visualization was clear and demonstrated my purpose, 
				but it was still lacking interest and visual appeal. To remedy <br/> this 
				some color was added to the bars. 
			</p>

				<img src="color.png" width = "800" height = "400">
				 <figcaption> Fig 3: Adding color for visual appeal </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Lastly, to emphasize what bar the user is hovering over, I added a 
				highlight feature to change the color of the bar when the curser <br/> 
				hovers over it.

		<H3> Rationale of Design Choices </H3>
			<p>
				I chose to use a bar graph for this visualization as they are one of the 
				most efficient channels for encoding both a quantitative <br/> and a 
				quantitative variable. For example, imagine if instead of a bar, a line 
				was used. The viewer would still be able to discern <br/> which books had
				higher or lower average ratings based on the vertices of the line, but it 
				would be confusing why the separate <br/> books would be connected. This 
				is why using a bar graph in this situation is the best choice. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Color was added to each of the bars to make the graph more 
				visually interesting. The purpose of this is to grab the attention <br/> or 
				curiosity of the view more than a black and white image would. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Lastly, an additional color or highlight element was added when hovering
				over a particular bar to make it more clear what <br/> bar/book you were 
				on when the tooltip information is displayed.

		<H3> What I Discovered </H3> 
			<p>
				This visualization answers both parts of my research question. The first
				part, what books have the most ratings, is answered <br/> by the books that 
				appear. That is, the books that are displayed along the x-axis are the 
				18 most rated books on the Goodreads <br/> app. Utilizing the tooltip
				feature of the visualization allows the viewer to learn the number of 
				ratings each book has. For <br/> example, when hovering over 
				<i>Twilight</i> the viewer learns that is has an average rating of 3.59 
				out of 4,597,666 ratings. Making <br/> <i>Twilight</i> the most rated book
				on Goodreads.

				<img src="mostreviewed.png" width = "900" height = "400">
				 <figcaption> Fig 5: Twilight has the most ratings </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The second part of my research question, how do the average ratings compare 
				between the books with the most ratings, is answered <br/> by viewing the 
				graph. Visually, it is seen that the average rating of all the books is 
				relatively high and there is not a whole lot of <br/> variation between
				all of average ratings as they all range from about 3.5-4.5. Ultimately, 
				all of the most rated books on Goodreads <br/> have above average ratings.
